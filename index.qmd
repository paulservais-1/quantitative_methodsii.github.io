This website aims to support the class 'Methods for Research and Policy Evaluation', thaught in the school of Public Affairs of Sciences Po. 

# Course description

The objective of this course is to introduce quantitative methods for causal
inference, relying on mathematical formalization and applying them to concrete research situations.
Students will learn how to handle data - assembling a dataset, cleaning it, and preparing it for
quantitative analysis. The methods covered will include a review of linear models (simple and
multiple regressions) and nonlinear models (probit, logit), before moving on to the core of the
course: causal inference, namely DiD, RDD, and IV (2SLS, 2SRI). Each session will be divided equally
between the presentation of methods and their mathematical formulation, and in-class exercises
designed to help students master the associated coding techniques. The final goal is to replicate a
scientific article that applies one or more of these methods, enabling students to develop technical
skills useful for research or for the quantitative evaluation of public policies. Another objective is to
cultivate critical thinking regarding the strengths and limitations of such research methods. It is
therefore particularly well suited for students who wish to develop their skills in computer science,
mathematics, and quantitative research methods.

# Course objectives

* Identify and apply quantitative methods central to the evaluation of public policies
* Understand and compare key methodologies used in quantitative research for public policy
evaluation
* Acquire practical research skills necessary for effective policy analysis and evaluation
* Develop programming skills for data management and analysis and research applications in
public policy

# Prerequisites

* Basic coding skills (beginners welcome) - Stata, R, or Python are all acceptable. Students
should know how to use an IDE of their choice, how to import data, and have some
introductory knowledge of a programming language.
* Basic statistical concepts - e.g. students should know what a mean, a median, a standard
deviation, a statistical sample and statistical inference are.

# Course validation 

The course will be evaluated using a simplified pass/fail system. Evaluation will be based on a short
report (five pages) replicating a scientific article or a report that uses a causal inference method,
provided by the lecturers at the beginning of the semester. The writing of this report will be
supported incrementally throughout the semester, with guidance provided during each class, so that
students can progress step by step in the making of the paper.

# Course format

The course is structured with a 1-hour lecture (CM) followed by a 1-hour practical session (TP).
Students are required to have a computer with RStudio or Stata installed (Stata licenses are available
through Sciences Po). Each session begins with an introduction to the methods to be used, during
which their mathematical formalization is covered. The second part of the session focuses on
applying these methods to real-world data using RStudio or Stata. Classes are held every two weeks
for a total of 2 hours and are conducted in English.

The authors propose a robust DiD estimator with results differing from TWFE in their application.
