Her research focuses on health economics and policy evaluation, particularly how economic shocks affect the health of aging populations in Europe. French-American, she has academic experience in both France and the United States. She can be contacted at arielle.cohen\nPaul SERVAIS is a PhD Candidate in political science (comparative politics) in the Center for European and Comparative Politics of Sciences Po. His research analyses the electoral impacts of climate change’s consequences in France and Western Europe, with a particular focus on territorial cleavages (urban-rural, center-periphery). His work combines quantitative and qualitative research methods."

Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHeJoc27qEM Prof. Clément de Chaisemartin presents his work with Prof. Xavier d’Haultfœuille. The paper shows that Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) regressions are prone to bias from heterogeneous effects and contamination. The authors propose a robust DiD estimator with results differing from TWFE in their application."
